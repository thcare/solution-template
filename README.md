# Solution Template

Welcome to YOUR th.care framework powered Solution!

## Quickstart

### Start a codespace

The fastest way to get started is to spin up a codespace by clicking this button.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/thcare/solution-template)

Click that, and you'll get a new browser tab running VS Code with this readme open. See you on the other side!

### Initialise your development environment

In the VS Code [terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics) you can now run the following command:

```
npm run codespace:init
```

This will download some dependencies and prepare you to begin development of your solution.
