## `./prisma/`

This folder contains generated code derived from your solution's models in [`../schema/models/`](../schema/models/).

After making changes to your models, run `thfx prisma` to update the schema and create any needed [migrations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/mental-model).
